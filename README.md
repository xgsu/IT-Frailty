This folder contains the R computing files for the project - "Interaction Survival Tree for Recurrent Event Data with Frailty Models". 

1. The "examples.R" file contains two illustration examples: one using simulated data and the other based on the CGD data.
2. The "Functions-IT-Recurrent.R" contains all the self-written functions.
3. The "simulation" folder contains all the simulation files and results for Tables 1-4 in our manuscript "Precision Medicine: Interaction Survival Tree for 1
Recurrent Event Data" (accepted by Journal of Data Science).
